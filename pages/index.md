# Hello

I'm Dan Reeves, Staff Software Engineer at [Treasure Data](https://treasuredata.com). I mostly do JavaScript & React but I've been known to dabble in <abbr data-title="crystal, lua, rust, python, html, css, godot, php">other things</abbr>. I occasionally stream games or live coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rain_dish) and I run the [Cornwall Geeks](https://join.cornwallgeeks.net) meetup. 

I live in the UK and work remotely.

Want to talk? [Get in touch!](/contact)
