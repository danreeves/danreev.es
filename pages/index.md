# Hello

I'm Dan Reeves, Staff Software Engineer at [Treasure Data](https://treasuredata.com). I like writing JavaScript & <abbr data-title="rust, crystal, lua, python, gdscript, html, css, etc">other things</abbr>. You'll sometimes find me playing video games or reading books. I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rain_dish) and I also run the [Cornwall Geeks](https://join.cornwallgeeks.net) meetup. I live in the UK and work remotely.

Want to talk? [Get in touch!](/contact)
