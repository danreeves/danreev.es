# Hello, planet

Iâ€™m Dan Reeves, Tech Lead on the Frontend team at [Treasure Data](https://treasuredata.com). My day job is mostly React & TypeScript but I get up to a lot else.

I live in London but I've worked fully async & remote since 2017.

I've been heavily involved in the [Vermintide](https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/) and [Darktide](https://darkti.de/modding) modding communities where I write a lot of [lua](https://github.com/danreeves?tab=repositories&q=mods&type=source&language=lua&sort=).

Before all that, I worked on fullstack builds with php (WordPress) and python (Django), prototyping, ux testing, and much more for all variety of clients at [fffunction](https://fffunction.co/).

Outside of programming, I enjoy film photography. You can see it [here](https://dnrvs.photo).
