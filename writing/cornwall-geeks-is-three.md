# Cornwall Geeks is 3!

Woah! It‚Äôs not felt like three years but here we are. I‚Äôd like to take the time
to share a little of where I think we‚Äôve come from and where we‚Äôre going.

## How things began

Working with [fffunction](https://fffunction.co/), I had been to Bristol and
experienced the great web/tech community up there. I wondered if anything
existed back home. The groups I could find either seemed defunct or focussed on
the business or social media.
[I put the question to twitter](https://twitter.com/dnrvs/status/477208911083499520)
and people had similar feelings.

Pretty soon we had a handful of people around a table on a summers evening,
having drinks, and talking about what they do. It was good fun and
[began to be a regular occurrence](https://www.meetup.com/Cornwall-Digital/events/189751742/).

A few months later I was invited to a new Slack group: Falmouth Geeks. Since I
was joining from Truro it became Cornwall Geeks. As it was a similar group of
people with the same goals the meetup changed to share the name not long after.

## How things have changed

In the years since we‚Äôve seen an explosion in the tech community in Cornwall.
[Software Cornwall](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/),
[Kernow DAT](https://kernowdat.co.uk/), and
[Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/) in particular have been pushing
the bar for events and community outreach. The best display of this is the
tremendous growth show for the region in the
[Tech Nation Reports](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/tech-nation-report-2017/)
for the last couple years.

Luckily, when someone asks if there‚Äôs any meetups going on in Cornwall the
answer isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúTry Plymouth‚Äù anymore. (That‚Äôs not to say don‚Äôt go to Plymouth.
Do. [They‚Äôre](https://www.digitalplymouth.com/)

## Where things are going

I‚Äôm happy to say the community (in way of the Slack channel) is self sustaining
now. I can spend days not checking in but there‚Äôs still people having
conversations, sharing, and helping each other out. The meetup is also doing
well; to the point where people are expecting it and let us know when I forget
to set one up.

Finally, I‚Äôd like to thank all the people who were there in the beginning and
made the Cornwall Geeks community what it is today:
[Natalia](https://twitter.com/natkutala), [Iain](https://twitter.com/iainlobb),
[Dave](https://twitter.com/BigLittleFlan),
[Glen](https://twitter.com/glengineered),
[Robin](https://twitter.com/redannick), [Matt](https://twitter.com/hermitgames),
[Damien](https://twitter.com/Damien_Hogan),
[Tom](https://twitter.com/tomreadings), and
[Martin](https://twitter.com/martincoote).

A big shout out to [Belinda](https://twitter.com/belindawaldock) and
[Lyssa](https://twitter.com/LyssaCrump) for their work with
[Software Cornwall](https://twitter.com/swcornwall).
[Tony](https://twitter.com/tonyedwardspz) for his work on
[Kernow DAT](https://twitter.com/KernowDAT) and
[Future Sync](https://twitter.com/FutureSyncConf). Our friends up north working
on [Digital Plymouth](https://twitter.com/DigitalPlymouth).

I‚Äôm not going to lie and say I enjoy the organisation and admin aspects. I
really only do what little I do so I have a community to be a part of. I didn‚Äôt
do it alone though; [Natalia](https://twitter.com/natkutala) has always been
there behind the scenes arranging projectors and speakers, setting up meetups
and booking rooms. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what we‚Äôve started and hope it keeps
on growing.
