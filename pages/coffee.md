# Coffee

Keeping track of the coffee I've tried and what I thought of them:

| Brand  | Origin | Name      | Type           | Notes               | Rate |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| Origin | Brazil | Das Almas | Pulped Natural | Nutty, bitter, mild | 6/10 |
