# Helloooooo

I'm Dan Reeves, Frontend Engineer at [Arm Treasure Data](https://treasuredata.com). I like writing JavaScript & Rust. You'll sometimes find me playing video games or reading books. I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rain_dish) and I also run the [Cornwall Geeks](https://join.cornwallgeeks.net) meetup. I live in the UK and work remotely.
