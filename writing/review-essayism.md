# Review: Essayism

*Essayism* is a book on fragments; of fragments extricable, but a whole
indivisible. Fragments of essays, history, theory, anecdote and lesson.

It is, fascinatingly all at once, an exploration of the essay, a biography of
the authors depression, and a handbook to its own creation. It so flawlessly
weaves these threads together, calling upon digressions in a way so calculated
and clever, that you might not even notice.
