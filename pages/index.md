# Hello

I'm Dan Reeves, Staff Software Engineer at [Treasure Data](https://treasuredata.com). My work is mostly JavaScript & React but I do a lot else!

I'm heavily involved in the [Vermintide Modding Community](https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/) where I write a lot of [lua](https://github.com/danreeves/vermintide-2-mods), and recently a Blender plugin in Python. This site is written in [crystal](https://github.com/danreeves/danreev.es). I also enjoy developing games in Godot with GDScript.

You can see my film photography [here](https://dnrvs.photo).

I live in the UK and work remotely.
