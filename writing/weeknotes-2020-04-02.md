# weeknotes 2

wow 2 months later...

here's my progress:
- travel is not happening for the forseeable due to covid-19
- i started working on a game!
- i got a new keyboard that i like a fair bit
- i've already finished 3 books this year and dropped one half way through
- i updated the styles here a bit

## projects
one goal of this year is to output more stuff. i've starting working on the first of many games. it's a passion i've wanted to embrace for far too long.

i also worked on a small web project for my favourite game: [Vermintide 2 Leaderboard](http://vt2leaderboards.onrender.com]. This was fun as it involved interacting with the Steam and PlayFab APIs.
