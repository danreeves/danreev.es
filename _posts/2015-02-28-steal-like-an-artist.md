Next time you're about to include jQuery in your project, stop for a moment. Think, do you really need the whole library, or are you only after a certain [feature](http://api.jquery.com/)? [Look](http://npmjs.org/) for a smaller library that will solve your problem without the overhead.

If it doesn't exist, [write it](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules). Don't know how? [Steal it](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src).

My biggest piece of advice for front-end developers is to not just use a library but to understand it. Read it, take it apart, learn from it. You'd be surprised at how simple a lot of things are; it's not magic.

Ditching large libraries like jQuery isn't an [NIH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) thing either. Don't get caught up in trying to write your own solutions. Nothing is original, so take what's already good and make it better.

The most important thing to remember when writing Javascript without jQuery is to not forget the countless problems that have already been solved. jQuery fixes [far more bugs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPaPA30bLUB_publLIMF0RlhdnPx_ePXm7oW02iiT6o/view#heading=h.g284ogexrg8a) than you'd think. But, it's also not flawless.

Next time you're about to write some code, stop for a moment. Think, has this already been done? Look at some of the [best](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended) [code](https://github.com/trending?l=javascript&since=monthly) [you](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) [can](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore) [find](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js). Figure out what's worth stealing, move onto the next thing.

Steal like an artist.
