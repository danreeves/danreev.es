# Of Practice

> What I write here is not my teaching, but my study; it is not a lesson for
others, but for me. And yet it should not be held against me if I publish what I
write. What is useful to me may by accident be useful to another. Moreover, I am
not spoiling anything, I am only using what is mine. And if I play the fool, it
is at my expense and without harm to anyone. For it is a folly that will die
with me, and will have no consequences.

— Michel de Montaigne, ‘Of Practice’

> I quote others only in order the better to express myself.

— also Michel de Montaigne
