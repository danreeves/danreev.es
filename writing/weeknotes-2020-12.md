# Weaknotes

 - I've been thinking about what I want to accomplish this year
 - Writing more is something I want to do more this year
 - Producing things is something I want to do more of this year
 - I got this idea from [a pale slim ghost](https://blog.153.io/2018/10/22/weeknotes-3/)
 - Some current goals for the year:
    - Lose some weight
    - Start learning Swedish
    - Release a small game
    - Read 12 books (again. I did it in 2018 and utterly failed in 2019)
    - Run more. I did 3 half-marathons in 2019. I'd like to run a 25k in 2020.
    - Keep up the guitar.
 - I want to redesign this website at some point
 - I want to finish my little maplestory project

# Travel
 - I want to Amsterdam and Germany over the winter break which was awesome. I enjoy spending time with my friends.
 - I'm off to Seattle again in a few weeks which is very exciting.

I'm going to push this now and see if my build still works and how this looks. I'll try remember to keep this up. :)
